Magus is a three-button character made for MUGEN 1.0.
This is not a final version but it should be playable.

What's Missing:

- Further distinguish his magic modes
- 12p mode
- Specific character interactions (intros, winposes, double techs, maybe)


## Moveset

Magus is a slow walker but a fast runner.His strong hit 
is a good launcher. He also has three "magic modes": 
Light, Water and Fire. This affects some of his moves' damage and behavior. 
You can switch between magic modes by taunting. An icon will appear 
over Magus' head to indicate the new mode.

### Special Moves

- **Black Hole**: `B, D, DB, a/b/c` (Ground)

Requires 500 Power. Magus creates a black hole under him that will absorb 
the first enemy that steps in it. Qualifies as a throw.

- **Shadow Walk**: `F, D, DF, a+b/b+c` / `B, D, DB, a+b/b+c` (Ground)

Magus vanishes into the shadows, becoming intangible. The `F, D, DF` versions 
move forward, while the `B, D, DB` versions move backwards. The `a+b` versions 
travel less distance than the `b+c` versions.

- **Dark Mist**: `F, D, DF, a/b/c` (Ground)

Magus jumps into the air while doing three spinning slashes with his scythe.
This attack's angle and speed depend on the button used.

- **Elemental Magic**: `D, DF, F, a/b/c` (Ground)

Magus casts a basic spell using his current magic mode. 

Light summons lightning that falls at a distance that depends on 
the button pressed.

Water creates a small bubble that travels a short distance and stays 
in the air for a bit. The angle of the bubble's trajectory depends on 
the button pressed.

Fire throws a flame. The speed and angle depends on the button pressed. 

### Super Moves

- **Dark Matter**: `D, DF, F, D, DF, F, a/b/c` (Ground)

Requires 1000 Power. Magus fires a tear in spacetime that moves forward and hits
multiple times.

- **Hell's Geyser**: `D, DB, B, D, DB, B, a/b/c` (Ground)

Requires 1000 Power. Magus creates a soul stream in front of him that deals 
continuous damage.

- **Black Wind**: `D, B, D, F, a/b/c` (Ground)

Requires 1000 Power. Magus dashes forwards. If he hits his opponent, they will 
be cut multiple times. Qualifies as a throw.

### Special Mode

- **Magic Wall**: `a + c` (Ground)

Requires 3000 Power. Magus raises his Magic Defense. While his Magic Wall is up,
Magus is immune to projectile damage, and all projectile attacks are 
automatically countered with a small projectile.

Additionally, Magus' magic mode switches to his true element, Shadow. 
His Elemental Magic (`D, DF, F, a/b/c`) changes to **Dark Bomb**. 
The Dark Bomb's position depends on the button pressed. Magus' Power will 
deplete automatically while in this state.

### Final Move

- **Midnight Blackness**: `D, F, D, B, a/b/c` (Ground while Magic Wall is 
active)

Spends all remaining Power. Magus advances towards its opponent. If he hits 
them, he transforms them into an "alternate form and drains some of their 
energy, healing himself a bit. Qualifies as a throw.
